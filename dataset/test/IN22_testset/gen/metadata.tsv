If an application violates this protocol by installing an update before logging it and then for some reason must abort, or the system crashes, there is no systematic way to discover the installed update and, if necessary, reverse it.

The starting point is usually to employ a finer lock granularity: lock smaller objects, such as individual data records, individual pages of data records, or even fields within records. The trade-offs in gaining concurrency are first, that when there is more than one lock, more time is spent acquiring and releasing locks and second, cor rectness arguments become more complex. One hopes that the performance gain from concurrency exceeds the cost of acquiring and releasing the multiple locks.	web		education	30	26 - 45

Nowadays, films gather the diversity of India through the influence of the classical epics of Sanskrit with recurrent themes like maternity and revenge or trying to maintain the traditional values that conformed the social hyerarchy of India. This influence is also felt in the narrative structure of films, often with digressions that make Indian films too long for the western audience. The influence of theatrical forms is also present, with an episodic structure, an emphasis on performance over realism and the introductions of traditional music like the sangeetas, a mixture of instrumental music, song, dance and humour, elements that come from the classical theatre and the Parsi theatre.	web		entertainment	38	26 - 45

Furthermore, such images contain systematic errors due to atmospheric effects (as a function of the path length) as well as monotonically changing spatial resolution for most coarse resolution sensors. Their classification is therefore difficult and requires interactive fine tuning for each input scene used, as well as post-classification operations to reconcile differences between adjacent scenes to ensure consistency across the mapped area. For these reasons, research in recent years has emphasised the use of image composites.	web		geography	14	11 - 17
High relative humidities in the lower and middle troposphere are also required for cyclone development. These high humidities reduce the amount of evaporation in clouds and maximizes the latent heat released because there is more precipitation. The vertical wind shear in a tropical cyclones environment is also important.	web		geography	15	11 - 17
If that land is not available because it has already been developed, then the farming sector will be less able to adapt. It may make sense to preserve land for future agricultural production, even if it is not currently being used for that purpose. Similarly, forest land that is currently dominated by lower-valued species may become more valuable in the future, and vice versa.	web		geography	20	18 - 25
In the past, some classification projects employing coarse resolution data were carried out with single-date, relatively cloud-free images. However, this approach is fundamentally limited because the probability of cloud-free scenes decreases as the area covered by one scene increases. It is thus very difficult to obtain useful images for land cover mapping, especially if the eligible time interval is short.	web		geography	21	18 - 25
In the recent developments, importance is being given to utilization of hyper-spectral domain for soil physical and chemical characterization.

Manual, or visual, classification of remotely sensed data is an effective method of classifying land cover especially when the analyst is familiar with the area being classified. This method uses skills that were originally developed for interpreting aerial photographs. It relies on the interpreter to employ visual cues such as tone, texture, shape, pattern, and relationship to other objects to identify the different land cover classes (figure 2.3), The primary advantage of manual interpretation is its utilization of the brain to identify features in the image and relate them to features on the ground.	web		geography	27	26 - 45

Remote sensing techniques for monitoring water quality depend on the ability to measure these changes in the spectral signature backscattered from water and relate these measured changes by empirical or analytical models to water quality parameters. Major factors affecting water quality are suspended sediments, algae, chemicals, dissolved organic matter (DOM), thermal releases, aquatic vascular plants, pathogens, and oils. Some of these parameters like suspended sediments, algae, DOM, oils, aquatic vascular plants, and thermal releases directly influence the energy spectra and hence can be measured by remote sensing techniques (table 6.3).	web		geography	22	18 - 25

On the interpretation of clause 6.4.6, learned counsel submitted that the said clause carries a heavy penalty; that the said clause is attracted in cases of tampering/wrong routing of calls attributable to some fault on the part of the operator and not otherwise, and since in the present case the actions complained are attributable to an unscrupulous subscriber and not to Reliance, clause 6.4.6 cannot be invoked.

Learned senior counsel further submitted that the contention of BSNL regarding strict civil liability is entirely misplaced as BSNL does not possess any statutory power to impose such liability.	web		legal	69	61 - 80

In Southern India, the Pallava period beginning with Simhavishnu (575 CE 900 CE) was a transitional stage in southern Indian society with monument building, establishment of (bhakti) sects of Alvars and Nayanars, flowering of rural Brahmanical institutions of Sanskrit learning, and the establishment of Chakravartin model of kingship over a territory of diverse people; which ended the pre-Pallavan era of territorially segmented people, each with their culture, under a tribal chieftain. The Pallava period extolled ranked relationships based on ritual purity as enjoined by the shastras.

The post-1980 Ratsiraka and Zafy regimes have overseen the privatization of parastatals, the disbanding of agricultural marketing boards, the ratification of more liberal investment codes favoring foreign investment, the privatization of the banking industry, diversification of traditional, primary-product exports, and greater investment in food production. The Zafy regime has made reinvigoration of the Malagasy economy its number-one priority.	wiki	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Madagascar	economy	46	46 - 60

A chaotic system may have sequences of values for the evolving variable that exactly repeat themselves, giving periodic behavior starting from any point in that sequence. However, such periodic sequences are repelling rather than attracting, meaning that if the evolving variable is outside the sequence, however close, it will not enter the sequence and in fact, will diverge from it. Thus for almost all initial conditions, the variable evolves chaotically with non-periodic behavior.	wiki	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory	education	34	26 - 45
A leap second is a one-second adjustment that is occasionally applied to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), to accommodate the difference between precise time (International Atomic Time (TAI), as measured by atomic clocks) and imprecise observed solar time (UT1), which varies due to irregularities and long-term slowdown in the Earth's rotation. The UTC time standard, widely used for international timekeeping and as the reference for civil time in most countries, uses TAI and consequently would run ahead of observed solar time unless it is reset to UT1 as needed.

These cells, along with the epidermal guard cells of the stoma, form a system of air spaces and chambers that regulate the exchange of gases.	wiki	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_tissue	education	50	46 - 60
Thomas precession is a kinematic effect in the flat spacetime of special relativity. In the curved spacetime of general relativity, Thomas precession combines with a geometric effect to produce de Sitter precession. Although Thomas precession (net rotation after a trajectory that returns to its initial velocity) is a purely kinematic effect, it only occurs in curvilinear motion and therefore cannot be observed independently of some external force causing the curvilinear motion such as that caused by an electromagnetic field, a gravitational field or a mechanical force, so Thomas precession is usually accompanied by dynamical effects.	wiki	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_precession	education	63	61 - 80
Unlike a traditional incandescent lamp, an LED will light only when voltage is applied in the forward direction of the diode. No current flows and no light is emitted if voltage is applied in the reverse direction. If the reverse voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage, a large current flows and the LED will be damaged.	wiki	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode	education	21	18 - 25

If the troponin is negative, a treadmill exercise test or a thallium scintigram may be requested.	wiki	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_coronary_syndrome	health	17	11 - 17
A circadian rhythm (), or circadian cycle, is a natural, internal process that regulates the sleepwake cycle and repeats roughly every 24 hours. It can refer to any process that originates within an organism (i.e., endogenous) and responds to the environment (entrained by the environment). These 24-hour rhythms are driven by a circadian clock, and they have been widely observed in animals, plants, fungi and cyanobacteria.	wiki	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm	health	22	18 - 25
"Agonism of the 5-HT2A receptor is an antitarget because 5-HT2A receptor agonists are associated with hallucinogenic effects. According to David E. Nichols, ""Discussions over the years with many colleagues working in the pharmaceutical industry have informed me that if upon screening a potential new drug is found to have serotonin 5-HT2A agonist activity, it nearly always signals the end to any further development of that molecule."" There are some exceptions however, for instance efavirenz and lorcaserin, which can activate the 5-HT2A receptor and cause psychedelic effects at high doses."	wiki	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antitarget	health	49	46 - 60

"In the Advaita tradition, moksha (liberation from suffering and rebirth) is attained through recognizing this illusoriness of the phenomenal world and disidentification from the body-mind complex and the notion of 'doership', and acquiring vidy (knowledge) of one's true identity as Atman-Brahman, self-luminous (svayam praka) awareness or Witness-consciousness. Upanishadic statements such as tat tvam asi, ""that you are,"" destroy the ignorance (avidy) regarding one's true identity by revealing that (jiv)tman is non-different from immortal Brahman. While the prominent 8th century Vedic scholar and teacher (acharya) Adi Shankara emphasized that, since Brahman is ever-present, Brahman-knowledge is immediate and requires no 'action', that is, striving and effort, the Advaita tradition also prescribes elaborate preparatory practice, including contemplation of the mahavakyas and accepting yogic samadhi as a means to knowledge, posing a paradox which is also recognized in other spiritual disciplines and traditions."	wiki	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta	religion	64	61 - 80

Roy Tseng, drawing on the New Confucians of the twentieth century, argues that Confucianism and liberal democracy can enter into a dialectical process, in which liberal rights and voting rights are rethought into resolutely modern, but nonetheless Confucian ways of life. This synthesis, blending Confucians rituals and institutions with a broader liberal democratic frame, is distinct from both Western-style liberalism which, for Tseng, suffers from excessive individualism and a lack of moral vision and from traditional Confucianism which, for Tseng, has historically suffered from rigid hierarchies and sclerotic elites. Against defenders of political meritocracy, Tseng claims that the fusion of Confucian and democratic institutions can conserve the best of both worlds, producing a more communal democracy which draws on a rich ethical tradition, addresses abuses of power, and combines popular accountability with a clear attention to the cultivation of virtue in elites.	wiki	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism	religion	48	46 - 60

Visitors to the national park have many options, including: the remote North Rim; the more accessible (and therefore more crowded) South Rim; parts of the canyon, such as Phantom Ranch or the Colorado River, upon which many boating trips are made.	wiki	https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Grand_Canyon	tourism	31	26 - 45
